# AAPP - Grep-Challenge
Advanced Algorithms and Parallel Programming Grep Challenge - a.a. 2022-2023<br>
**Professor:** [Fabrizio Ferrandi](https://ferrandi.faculty.polimi.it/)
## The challenge 
The goal of this challenge was to write a MPI implementation of a parallel grep function working on any number of cores.<br>
This challenge granted me 4 out of 4 points in the "Parallel Programming" partial exam.<br>
The code and the documentation was wrote on Google Colab and can be found [here](grep_challenge_sanguineti.ipynb).
